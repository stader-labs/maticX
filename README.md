# Deploying

To deploy on testnet run:

```bash
npm run deploy:test
```

To deploy on mainnet run:

```bash
npm run deploy:main
```

To deploy contract directly, run:

```bash
npx hardhat deployFxStateChildTunnel --network matic
npx hardhat deployRateProvider <fxStateChildTunnelAddress> --network matic
npx hardhat deployChildPoolImpl --network matic
npx hardhat deployChildPoolProxy <fxStateChildTunnelAddress> <maticX> <manager> <instantPoolOwner> <treasury> <instantWithdrawalFeeBps> --network matic
npx hardhat deployFxStateRootTunnel <maticXAddress> --network mainnet
npx hardhat deployMaticXImpl --network mainnet
npx hardhat deployValidatorRegistryImpl --network mainnet
```

# Upgrading

```bash
npx hardhat run ./scripts/upgradeMaticX.ts --network <network>
npx hardhat run ./scripts/upgradeValidatorRegistry.ts --network <network>
```

# Verifying on etherscan

```bash
npx hardhat verifyMaticX --network <network>
npx hardhat verify <address> <...args> --network <network>
```

# Testing

```bash
npx hardhat test
```
